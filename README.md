# Latencylab

This project was developed as part of the course Network Technologies for Multimedia Applications within my Masters program at the University of Vienna.
It uses a Angular frontend and a public backend to display differnt levels of latency management within the UI.

## Starting project

The project can be started using the following command:
```ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json```

## Latency strategies

The first page uses a standard loading wheel, the second one a loading bar and the third one a page skeleton with loading animations within each card.
